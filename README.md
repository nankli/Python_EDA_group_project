## Project Title: Global Warming: A Detailed Look at Historical Trends, Variations and Issues of Burden and Responsibilities

### Introduction
Over the past decades, climate change and global warming have emerged as the greatest challenge that humanity has ever faced.  Research has shown that the emission of greenhouse
gases (GHG) is a major contributor to the phenomenon, which is a looming threat to life as we know it on earth.  While it is widely recognized that climate change is a global 
phenomenon, we believe that through data analysis, we will be able to gain a better understanding of the nuances.

This is the group project where we attempt to:
(a) show how the trends of GHG emission and global warming have changed over time and whether we can observe any patterns between the two; 
(b) explore whether the warming is taking place evenly, both in terms of different geographical locations and times of the year; and
(c) look at the issues of cause and burden sharing, i.e. which countries have been major contributors in terms of GHG emission and which countries may potentially be most affected.

This is the repository for the project.

### How to use this repository
The repository contains the following files:

(i) at the root directory, it contains: (a) the project proposal, (b) final report, (c) slide deck for presenting results, (d) jupyter notebook used to explore various issues

(ii) inside the "codes" folder, it contains various python files that are primarily used to fetch and process the data from Berkeley Earth

(iii) inside the "data_files" folder, it contains some of the high level CSV files we generated.  Not every CSV files are provided, but only smaller sized ones.  For the full set
of files (e.g. the over 3500 city-based CSVs) we used, please run the relevant python scripts.

(iv) inside the "graphs" folder, it contains a png file used in one of the notebooks, as well as various graphs generated for preparing the project proposal.  Also, it contains
a GIF file that has also been uploaded to one of the creator's google drive and is linked to in the final report.

### Hope you enjoy going through our work!!
